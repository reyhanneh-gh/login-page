### 👩‍💻 About the Project  
This login page was created as part of my journey into mastering regular expressions and playful UI feedback. I wanted to build a form that feels alive — where even the cat reacts to your actions. It helped me practice input validation, event-driven animations, and modular DOM logic. The result is a charming, responsive login experience that blends functionality with delight.
